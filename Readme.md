# Redux toolkit/ RTK vs React query

This is a small todo application that will give you the main differences between these two solutions for fetching data and caching the results.

You will have three brunches:

```
1) main
2) redux-toolkit-RTK
3) react-query-version
```

the main branch has the minium code you need to run this application, and in the other two you will have the code related to each library and implementation.

To get the server up and running with sample data you need to:

```
npm run db-populate
```

You will have some data from a server coming from `http://localhost:3500/todos`

You can also check the `get` response with Postman
